# README for align.py

This program performs global sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. It reads two biological sequences from a FASTA-formatted file provided as standard input and outputs their optimal alignment to standard output.

## Usage
Run the script from the command line by directing a FASTA file to it and capturing the output:
python3 align.py < input.fasta > output.txt

If you want to use an IDE or avoid the command line, there's a commented-out `main` method within `align.py`. You can uncomment this method and adjust the file path in the `parse` function call to directly run it with local FASTA files.

## Customization
To adjust the scoring scheme (match, mismatch, gap penalties), modify the following variables in `align.py`:
- M = 4  # Match score
- m = -2 # Mismatch penalty
- g = -2 # Gap penalty

## Input and Output
Your input should be a FASTA-formatted file containing exactly two sequences. The program will output the optimal alignment of these sequences according to the specified scoring scheme.

## Testing
You can test the script with provided `aligntest.input{1,2,3}` files and compare your script's output against the expected `aligntest.output{1,2,3}` files using:
diff aligntest.output1 my.output1

This ensures the alignment is calculated correctly according to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and your specified scoring parameters.
